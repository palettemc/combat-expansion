# ⚔️ Combat Expansion ⚔️

This data pack adds many different weapons, armor sets, and even enchantments to enhance your PvP experience!

Below is a list of how many new items/enchantments there are:
- 33 different weapons
- 4 overpowered armor sets
- 13 enchantments

*More items are coming in the future!*

## 🟢 Features

Apart from the equipment and the enchantments, a few features have been implemented to enhance both the adventure and combat parts of Minecraft.

### 💪 Powerful Mobs

Many of the weapons can easily defeat large numbers of hostile mobs. So, we added Powerful Mobs that have a rare chance of spawning. They are variants of regular hostile mobs who wield strong weapons and wear tanky armor, making them a tough challenge for anyone who comes by.

Below is an example of what a Powerful Zombie looks like at its maximum level.

Over time, Powerful Mobs grow stronger. They drop good loot, such as diamonds or even netherite scraps.

The following list contains every mob which has a Powerful variant:
- Zombie
- Husk
- Drowned
- Skeleton
- Stray
- Bogged
- Evoker
- Vindicator
- Piglin
- Piglin Brute
- Zombified Piglin

### 📖 Reworked Enchantments

Certain vanilla enchantments have been modified to become stronger. The list below includes which enchantments have been changed and how they have been changed.
- Sharpness: Now deals an extra 10% of damage per level rather than +0.5
- Impaling: Deals extra damage to all mobs, not just aquatic mobs
- Thorns: Returns more damage the lower the user is

## 🛠️ Installation and Usage

When installing any version, make sure you download both the data pack (marked with "[DP]") **and** the resource pack (marked with "[RP]").

In order for the data pack to work properly, the resource pack must also be installed; otherwise, all of the custom textures will break.

To apply the data pack to your new world, click on More, then click Datapacks, then you can drag-and-drop the data pack file into your Minecraft window.

To use the data pack, you can type `/function combat_expansion:_all_items` to view all of the different equipment and to give items to yourself.
